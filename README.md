# Budgie - Make your budget fly üí∏

Budgie is a modern e-commerce mobile app built for those on a tight budget. Created with React Native and Expo, featuring a beautiful UI with smooth animations and a focus on discount discovery. The app helps users find the best deals and manage their shopping cart efficiently.

The CoolShop name didn't cut it for me, so I decided to make my own! ü§©

## Reasoning ü§î

- I chose Expo with React Native because it's an unbelievable tool for creating mobile apps speedily and I have experience with it.
- I chose to create a wishlist because it was something that was mentioned in the first interview and I wanted to see if I could integrate it.
- The checkout button is there purely for fun!

## Things I didn't get around to üî¥

- I had an idea to create a few different styles of the app and had actually started creating a "comic" theme, but decided to focus on other things.
- I also wanted to add more micro animations and transitions on things like the quantity counter, filters, and sorting.
- There are plenty of things, but I'm satisfied with what I have.
